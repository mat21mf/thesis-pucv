The technique provides a succinct graphical representation of how well each object has been classified.The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from −1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. If most objects have a high value, then the clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative value, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters.
The silhouette can be calculated with any distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance or the Manhattan distance.},

The underlying principles of {GIS} are stressed and emphasis placed on the analysis and modelling of spatial data with applications to site selection and potential mapping. The book commences with a definition of {GIS} and describes a case study of mapping mineral potential. The ways in which spatial data are organized with models (raster, vector, relational) are discussed and data structures, such as quadtrees and topological structures are introduced. Data input including digitizing, geographic projections and conversions is covered together with output (visualization, representation of colour and spatial query). Spatial data transformations are dealt with thoroughly and attention is paid to map analysis and modelling as related to single maps, map pairs and multiple maps respectively. Methods of quantifying the associations between pairs of maps are emphasized. Finally, examples of landfill site selection and mineral potential mapping illustrate the application of map algebra for combining maps and tables with models, employing Boolean logic, index weighting, fuzzy logic and probability methods such as weights of evidence. There is an extensive glossary of terms, and references accompany each chapter. Contains 40 pages of colour illustrations.},

    abstract = {k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.
The problem is computationally difficult ({NP}-hard); however, efficient heuristic algorithms converge quickly to a local optimum. These are usually similar to the expectation-maximization algorithm for mixtures of Gaussian distributions via an iterative refinement approach employed by both k-means and Gaussian mixture modeling. They both use cluster centers to model the data; however, k-means clustering tends to find clusters of comparable spatial extent, while the expectation-maximization mechanism allows clusters to have different shapes.
The algorithm has a loose relationship to the k-nearest neighbor classifier, a popular machine learning technique for classification that is often confused with k-means due to the name. Applying the 1-nearest neighbor classifier to the cluster centers obtained by k-means classifies new data into the existing clusters. This is known as nearest centroid classifier or Rocchio algorithm.},
